title: iOS treats HTML5 rotation differently in mobile Safari over a native web view

In June of 2011, we learned that the [Nitro JavaScript Engine ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine)was being added to iOS 4.3. This, of course, got every mobile HTML5 app developer excited to learn about the potential for [2.5 times speed increase](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/06/ios-5-brings-nitro-speed-to-home-screen-web-apps/) of our apps. Over the course of a year, I, along with other developers, became accustomed to expecting our apps to behave slower when using web views.  I've been primarily working on a Sencha Touch 2.0 application that is designed to be consumed with Mobile Safari instead of being embedded on the iOS Springboard.  I got used to the rotation behavior with this app as designed, but discovered a very different behavior for rotation when the app is embedded in a web view. What we discovered might surprise you. [Breaking down HTML5 app rotation iOS](http://vimeo.com/44738703) from [Modus Create](http://vimeo.com/moduscreate) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).
