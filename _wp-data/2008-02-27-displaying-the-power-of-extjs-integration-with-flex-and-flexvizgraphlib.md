title: Displaying the power of EXTJS integration with FLEX and flexvizgraphlib

---

For my employer, I'm currently experimenting with an awesome FLEX library called [flexvizgraplib ](http://groups.google.com/group/flexvizgraphlib)which is nothing short of remarkable.    It was relatively easy to integrate with [EXTJS](http://extjs.com/).Â   Essentially, this application map is gathered via queries to my employer's installation of [HP Universal Configuration Manager Database](https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&cp=1-11-15-25%5E1059_4000_100__) without having to use their unreliable API.Â Â     The maps will represent dependency relationships with applications, servers and databases.Â  This application serves as an Operations Portal for my employer's data center.
