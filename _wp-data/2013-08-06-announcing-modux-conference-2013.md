We promised amazing things in 2013, (reflecting on [Modus Turns Two](http://moduscreate.com/modus-create-turns-2/)) and we delivered!





Modus Create is proud to announce our first conference, [ModUX](http://moduxcon.com/), at the Felix Meritis in Amsterdam, Sept 18-20th. The conference offers 1 bootcamp, 16 hours, 18 sessions, 10 lightning rounds, and an awesome party.

The Modus Create team has traveled around the US to speak at conferences, such as, SenchaCon, DevCon5, and more. We've organized events in Washington DC, New York, and San Francisco to promote Jay Garcia's recently published book, [Sencha Touch in Action](http://manning.com/garcia2). Now, we’re launching our first conference in Europe and we couldn’t be more excited!





The Modus team will be organizing the conference, speaking at the conference, and leading discussions. We are working hard to build an incredible schedule of speakers who are well-known community advocates and industry experts working for awesome companies and doing big things.





The conference is designed to be an exclusive and community-focused event. We are bringing together engineers, architects, and entrepreneurs to the beautiful tech-centric city of Amsterdam to share ideas and to discuss the future of the mobile and desktop web industry.
