title: How to integrate the Progress Bar with the Paging Toolbar

---

While the Paging Toolbar class was introduced in Ext 1.0, it has changed little to the users all the way up to 3.0 as we know it.Â  In Ext 2.0, the Progress Bar class was introduced.Â  A couple of days ago, I [posted](http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=58058) on the [Ext JS forums](http://extjs.com/forum/) about this idea and got some good responses, so I decided to finalize the 2.2 extension, Ext.ux.plugins.progressPagingToolbar.Â  Yes, I know it's an uglyÂ  name.

[MJ Lecomte](http://extjs.com/forum/member.php?u=6834), a great and active community member, [suggested](http://extjs.com/forum/reputation.php?p=278375) a plugin instead of an extension for Ext 3, which made a whole lot of sense.Â  So, I created the plugin for the Ext 3.0 branch, which I'm working to get submitted as example code for the Ext JS SDK, much like I did for the [2.2 release](http://extjs.com/blog/2008/08/04/ext-22-released/) (See "Advanced Drag and Drop Examples").Â  I cannot link to the private beta link for the plugin until Ext 3 is generally available (GA).
