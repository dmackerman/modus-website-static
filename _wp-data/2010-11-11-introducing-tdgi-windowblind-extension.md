In 2008, [Sean McDaniel](http://mcdconsultingllc.com/blinds) created a Blind solution for Ext JS 2.x and released it for the public to use.  Springboarding off of his idea, we figured why not port over the blind to the framework for [Ext JS 3.x](http://sencha.com/products/extjs).  Being that [Jay Garcia](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tdginnovations) will be demonstrating this at [SenchaCon 2010](http://sencha.com/conference), we figured why not release it beforehand.





###  Abstract 





The OS X window blind is a very well known user interface (see below).  Being that OS X is a "Window management system", everything you interact with is contained by some window.  When the application requires input in a modal fashion, designers are faced with two paradigms: Modal popup dialogue (typically found on MS Windows), or a blind.
  
  






Below is an example of a Blind used in the via the save menu of Safari:

Firefox displays typical alert/prompt dialogues using the blinds.

### Enter WindowBlinds for Ext JS 3.x 





[Ext JS 3.x](http://sencha.com/products/extjs), being a powerful UI framework for the web, mimics a lot of Windows Vista and Windows 7.  That said, we think that there is a lot of room for this type of UI widget inside of our Ext JS applications.
