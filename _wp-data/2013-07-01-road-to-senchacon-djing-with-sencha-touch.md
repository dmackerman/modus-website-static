Modus Create is honored to not only sponsor [SenchaCon](http://senchacon.com) but to have its team members present during the conference as well. This post previews the work behind the [DJing with Sencha Touch](http://senchacon.com/sessions/#djingwithtouch) session presented by Stan Bershadskiy.





# DJing with Sencha Touch





The purpose of this session is to highlight two fantastic technologies: Sencha Touch and the HTML5 Web Audio API. The real magic happens when they are combined, the possibilities are endless. The end result is a full-fledged DJ app, similar to Traktor DJ, djay, but as a browser app.





The app was written using Sencha Touch 2.2 and uses some external libraries for supporting the audio aspects.





## Overview





The app consists of 3 components, mimicking what is used in almost every DJ app:







  * Mixer




  
  * 
    3 Band EQ
  

  
  * 
    Volume Fader and Meter
  

  
  * 
    Crossfader
  





  * Two Decks




  
  * 
    Realtime waveform
  

  
  * 
    Play & Cue
  

  
  * 
    Pitch Fader & Bending
  

  
  * 
    Looping
  





  * Track Browser





Without giving too much away prior to SenchaCon here's a little peek of what the app will look like:
