title: Experimental Sencha Touch 2.0 automated Phonegap builds to iOS and android

categories:

In the screencast below, I demo a BASH script that I created to work through automating the publishing of Sencha Touch 2.0 application code to both PhoneGap iOS and android builds.  We're hoping to make this more solidified moving forward and publish as a design pattern.

More to come ;)
