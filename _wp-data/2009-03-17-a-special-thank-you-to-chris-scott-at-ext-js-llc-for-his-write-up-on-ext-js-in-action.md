title: A special thank you to Chris Scott at Ext JS, LLC for his write up on Ext JS In Action


---

I was elated to read Chris Scott's review of Ext JS In Action this morning at [http://extjs.com/blog](http://extjs.com/blog).  

Here is a quick blurb from the [ExtJS.com blog post](http://extjs.com/blog/2009/03/16/ext-js-books/):



> "The author, Jesus Garcia is a long-time member of the Ext JS forums with a well-documented history of helping others in his 7600+ posts. His book, Ext JS In Action, will make an excellent companion to Learning Ext JS below, since it takes a more-technical bottom-up approach to teaching Ext JS. Mr. Garcia demonstrates a thorough understanding of low-level DOM manipulation and event-handling, including the differences between browsers."



See [http://extjs.com/blog](http://extjs.com/blog) for the full details.

My Sincere thanks to Chris and all of the Members of the Ext Company for their support of Ext JS In Action.
