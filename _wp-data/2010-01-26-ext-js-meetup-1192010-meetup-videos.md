# Thank you!


Our [Ext JS meetup](http://moduscreate.com/219/three-pillar-global-plays-host-to-an-extjs-gathering) on 1/19/2010 at [Three Pillar Global](http://threepillarglobal.com) was rather successful!  We had over 30 developers show up with less than three weeks notice of the event.  This caused an overflow of visitors, where they had to sit outside of the room.
