title: A quick demo of Ext JS in Action's chapter 11 (drag and drop with grids)


---

I know that I have not been posting much and have been behind with screecasts and all.   I just wanted to take a moment and just say that I've been ridiculously busy with family matters, work and the book.  

I'm currently working on Chapter 11 of Ext JS in Action and wanted also to give you this quick preview of some of the cool stuff to expect.
