[Jay Garcia in an Ext JS meetup 3-24-10](http://vimeo.com/10668802) from [Jay Garcia](http://vimeo.com/user3205431) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Here, I describe what the Ext JS designer is about and demonstrate it live.  I also deliver a little bit of news on the new ION product that Ext JS is to release.
