title: OS Ext Dock part 2

---

I got the logic down pat for creating icons on the left and right.Â  If you're not an OS X user; the icons left of the 'runway' (divider) are for launching applications and the right are a location for minimized windows.Â  What the video shows is what it looks like to register an icon in the dock as an application launcher ( no animation ) and a minimized window container (animated).

Next is setting up the full context menus (minimize, close, etc) and window (app?) registration for the icons.
