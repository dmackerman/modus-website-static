Often, we work on extensions in our spare time, but rarely release them due to serious time constraints.  With[ Ext JS in Action](http://manning.com) coming to a close and [going to print](http://extjsinaction.com/277), along with other things going on, our releases of new Ext JS extensions has been slowed down dramatically. But being that [Jay Garcia](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tdginnovations) is going to demo this at [SenchaCon 2010](http://sencha.com/conference), we figured that it would be good to release it publicly before hand.









### Introducing Ext.ux.TDGi.HudWindow


Being a fan of OS X, Jay designed the TDGi.HudWindow class is to mimic the OS X "HUD Window", introduced in Leopard. 








This UX largely consisted of modifying CSS and some modification of the DOM from the class itself after it renders.

Our [WindowDrawer](http://moduscreate.com/54/) extension allows your Ext JS apps to have OS X-like window drawers. If you have not seen it, we suggest checking it out.
