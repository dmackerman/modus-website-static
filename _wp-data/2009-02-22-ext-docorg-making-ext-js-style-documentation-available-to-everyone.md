title: 'Ext-doc.org : Making Ext JS style Documentation available to everyone'

---

The success of the framework can be contributed to one huge factor, documentation, documentation - one more time - documentation!Â  OK, that out of the way, the Ext 2.x [documentation](http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/docs/) is arguably the best in the market for any API. In my honest opinion, it beats the crap out of the API docs from many huge companies, which include Adobe and Microsoft.Â  Since 2.x rolled out in leary 2007, many developers have been drooling over the Ext documentation engine and many, including myself, wished we could have it for our own.Â  Now we can!Â  With [ext-doc](http://ext-doc.org/docs/), a free, opensource documentation generater, we can create beautiful API documenation for our own APIs.Â  I just joined the project and am hoping to submit some of my UI Extensions such as the tabpanel menu:

Here is the doc page: [http://code.google.com/p/ext-doc/](http://code.google.com/p/ext-doc/)Â  and related Ext JS [Forum](http://extjs.com/forum) [thread](http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=55214).
