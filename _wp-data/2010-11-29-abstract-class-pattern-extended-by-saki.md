[Jozef (Saki) Sakalos](http://www.sencha.com/forum/member.php?2178-jsakalos), an avid [Ext JS](http://sencha.com/products/extjs) supporter and good friend of Jay Garcia has posted an excellent article on how to extend the Abstract Class pattern that has been published via our ["Abstract class pattern" screencast](http://moduscreate.com/364/abstract-classes-with-ext-js) and Jay's book, [Ext JS in action](http://manning.com/extjsinaction).





In his [blog](http://blog.extjs.eu/), Saki has extended upon this pattern, adding variations to your factory methods, affording you greater flexibility when creating your abstract classes.





Below is an excerpt of code that demonstrates a variant to our Abstract pattern as been detailed in his [blog post](http://www.sencha.com/forum/member.php?2178-jsakalos).
