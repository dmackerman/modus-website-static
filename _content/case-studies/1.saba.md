When Saba wanted to take their enterprise learning management mobile, they reached out to Modus to provide and intensive Product Kickstart to immerse their in-house product team in a facilitated week of lean product development sessions geared to quickly pivot their desktop web app focused efforts to mobile.

After a week on site working with the product team to identify primary assumptions and design strategies to take the learning platform mobile, Modus followed up with four weeks of prototype and minimum viable product development to be user validated at the 2012 Saba Global User Summit.

Based on the feedback gained from the MVP’s, Saba was able to deliver both tablet and smartphone apps for it’s People Cloud product suite.
