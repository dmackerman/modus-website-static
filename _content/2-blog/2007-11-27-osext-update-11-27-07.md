title: OSExt Update 11-27-07

---

Wow - it's been a while since I've updated you guys on my work with the OSExt Desktop.  For now, the main mechanism for launching applications will be like a start-menu.  I'm hoping to have actual Dock icons for each application to mimic OS X as much as possible  - without the use of flash or the fish-eye effect (yuck!). I've done a lot of work to update the icon set for the windows.  I'm hoping to eventually center the title of the window and move the icons to the left.  This will require a user extension to the current Ext.Window object.

Right now this is still treated as highly experimental - thus I'm not going to release this to the public yet.  Hopefully in the next few weeks.   There are some serious bugs with IE (no surprise) and Safari.
