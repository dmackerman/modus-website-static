SenchaCon2013 is less than a month away and we’re doing a ton to make the most out of this year’s event. As a Premier Sencha Services Partner and a Gold Sponsor of the event this year, we can hardly contain our excitement to catch up with our Sencha community friends and make some new ones in Orlando!





**_Modus on Stage_**





Sign up to the Sencha Touch track to see [Jay Garcia](http://senchacon.com/sessions/schedule/) present on custom component development and to hear architect [Stan Bershadskiy](http://senchacon.com/sessions/schedule/) discuss the DJ app he created using the HTML5 Web Audio API and Sencha Touch.





**_Get Product Strategy and Technical Advice_**





If you're looking to manage and deliver your next enterprise Sencha project with confidence, then we want to talk to you. Discuss your product plan with a Modus rep or get technical advice from one of our lead architects at the Modus lounge in the community pavilion.





**_Get Modus Goodies_**





Swing by the Modus lounge to meet the team and claim a Modus T-shirt. The first 20 folks to sign up to speak with a Modus architect will get a signed copy of _[Sencha Touch in Action](http://www.manning.com/garcia2/)_.





**_Looking forward to seeing you in Orlando!!--_**
