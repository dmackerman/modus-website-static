title: 'A quick preview of the ''HeaderToolbar'' plugin '

---

Here is a quick preview of the 'HeaderToolbar' plugin that adds some functionality to the Panel and Window classes of the Ext JS framework that mimic OS X window/panel Top Toolbar.  I'm looking for any comments/suggestions/etc.  I cannot release code until I get confirmation from Ext JS, LLC that I can do so, as I  have to modify and distribute overrides for the Window and Panel classes.
