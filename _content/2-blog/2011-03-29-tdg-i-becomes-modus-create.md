Reston, Virginia, Tuesday, March 29 "DC tech industry veterans Patrick Sheridan and Jay Garcia are excited to announce their new venture Modus Create, Inc. Modus Create is a digital agency that helps companies excite their customers with platform independent web, mobile, and tablet applications.




Sheridan had recently served as the Director of Product Strategy at Three Pillar Global after the 2009 acquisition of CloverLeaf Consulting, a user experience strategy firm he founded in 2005. Sheridan helped grow Three Pillar from 20 to 200 employees globally and deliver noted iPad, iPhone, and Android applications for PBS and Time, Inc.

The meteoric growth of Three Pillar is a testament to the talent of the executive team and dedicated staff and I will draw on that experience and friendships heavily moving forward with Modus Create,â€ said Sheridan. Sheridan has also been recently nominated to participate in the exclusive DC MindShare class of 2011.

Jay Garcia, who founded Frederick Maryland based TDG Innovations in 2006, will serve as the company's CTO. A core part of our growth strategy is consulting services, training, and product development based on the Sencha Touch HTML5 framework,â€ said Garcia, who recently authored ExtJS, in Actionâ€ for Manning Press and is currently authoring Sencha Touch, In Action.â€ We are excited to be the premier provider of Sencha consulting on the east coast.

The start of Modus is a very exciting development within the rapidly expanding Sencha Touch ecosystem,â€ said Jeff Hartley, Vice President of Services at Sencha. Jay Garcia and Pat Sheridan are skilled technologists and highly-regarded Sencha community advocates. We believe Modus will show customers directly that HTML5 is the right approach for enterprise mobile applications.â€

Modus Create will focus primarily on mobile apps for media, publishing, and entertainment.

Founded in March 2011, Modus Create provide high end solution design for mobile, tablet, and rich web applications. Modus Labs offers training, workshops, and custom learning engagements to empower their clients. More information is available at www.modus
