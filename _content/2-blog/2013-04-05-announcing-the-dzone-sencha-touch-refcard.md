### About





The Refcard was written for DZone by Stan Bershadskiy ([@stan229](http://www.twitter.com/stan229)) and edited by Grgur Grisogono ([@ggrgur](http://www.twitter.com/ggrgur)) and Jay Garcia ([@modusjesus](http://www.twitter.com/modusjesus)). Stan has been working with Sencha frameworks for the greater part of the last five years, particularly with Sencha Touch. You can see some of his Sencha Touch work here: [Time Inc.
