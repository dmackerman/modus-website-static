title: OS EXT desktop and theme in progress

---

Being inspired by the awesome looking [Start Menu Desktop](http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10950) example from mxracer at the [EXT Forums](http://extjs.com/forum), I decided to create an"OS EXT" (light pun on OS X) version of a desktop model.  The byproduct of this will be the "OS EXT" Theme which when complete, will be fully available. Please note that this is HIGHLY Experimental.
