We just wrapped up ModUX 2013, our very own developer conference. From September 18th to 20th, many of the brightest leaders of the web development community came together in Amsterdam for three days of excellent sessions, networking and fun. We were thrilled by the response. To all those who attended, sponsored and supported us, many thanks from the whole Modus Create team.





### The Future of the Web





ModUX proved that the modern web developer is not specialized in a single library, but is rather a complex individual capable of understanding the entire set of technologies such as Sencha Touch, WebRTC, responsive web design (RWD), PhoneGap, Angular, jQuery, Node.JS, and even Objective C. Polylingualism is not optional; it is a necessity in today's world.





Furthermore, modern web professionals are often required to go beyond programming. They need to understand how to run teams that are heavily influenced by nearly constant advances in technology. Those professionals welcomed ModUX as an event where they were able to discuss about Agile product management, Lean Startup principles, and even the influences of psychology in UX design.





### Modus Create Speakers





It's no secret that Modus Create is successfully built on the principles above. In fact, four of our team members presented our experience and excellence:







  * Patrick Sheridan, CEO: [5 New Rules for Software Product Development](http://moduxcon.com/speakers.html###5rules)


  * Jay Garcia, CTO: [Building Custom PhoneGap Plugins for iOS](http://moduxcon.com/speakers.html###phonegap)


  * Grgur Grisogono, VP: Opening and Closing Keynote


  * Alexandru Lazar, Software Engineer: [Exploring the Possibilities of Sencha and WebRTC](http://moduxcon.com/speakers.html###webrtc)

### ModUX in Numbers





During the three day program, we enjoyed **18 sessions** delivered by **20 speakers**, an amazing **BlackBerry bootcamp**, and a great boat party. More importantly, **154 attendees** helped create valuable experiences and millions of memories. It's worth noting that more than 70% of the attendees flew on international routes to get to ModUX in Amsterdam.





From developers to business leaders, 20 thought leaders shared valuable knowledge, information and tips about mobile web development and enterprise desktop web apps. We even learned about fresh business principles that are so key to project success.





### Attendee Feedback





Our feedback survey showed just how well ModUX was received amongst the attendees. [![Survey-web](../assets/uploads//2013/09/Survey-web1.png)](../assets/uploads//2013/09/Survey-web.png)
