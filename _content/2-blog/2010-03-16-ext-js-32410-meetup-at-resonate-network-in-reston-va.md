###### Keeping the momentum from our last two meetups,





On 3/24/10, Resonate Networks will be graciously hosting our Ext JS monthly meetup.





Kicking off the meetup will be a member of the Resonate Newtorks development team, who will demonstrate the power of the Gxt Library, including their implementation of charts and graphs.





Darren Govoni will demonstrate his remote JSON and JavaScript loader, for which he leverages in his own Ext JS application.





Lastly, I will be providing a live and private demonstration of the pre-alpha Ext JS designer.





Details can be found [http://www.meetup.com/NoVa-Javascript-Ext-JS-Users-Group/calendar/12781645/](http://www.meetup.com/NoVa-Javascript-Ext-JS-Users-Group/calendar/12781645/)





Be sure to register and RSVP quickly.  Seats have been going quickly.
