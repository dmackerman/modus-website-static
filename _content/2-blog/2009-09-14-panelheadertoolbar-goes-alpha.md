title: PanelHeaderToolbar goes alpha

---

I recently spent some time on the TDGi.PanelHeaderToolbar plugin and thought I should share it.

I'm currently working on the following features:
- Animated Collapse <-- Works
- Showing Raw buttons (option)  <- breaks auto sizing, need to investigate
- Add "collapse header toolbar" tool (matches feature from OS X) <- still under conceptuliaztion

Known issues:
<del>
- not fully compatible with IE7 & IE8 - surprised?
- Shadow for window out of sync.
- Expand/Collapse animations are not fully functional.
</del>
- Focus for input boxes doesn't fully work, one can initiate drag.  This will be a fun one to overcome.
