title: Window Drawers sneak peek part 3

---

Worked on the drawers a little more and wanted to show a simple use case.

Click [here](http://moduscreate.com/img/screencasts/2008-08-09_1050.swf) to see it in action.Â  Test drive the [four drawer demo](http://moduscreate.com/js/examples/ext/winDrawers/) and the [grid demo below](http://moduscreate.com/js/examples/ext/winDrawers/complex.html).

To Do list:



	
  * Enable resize for the drawers

	
  * Honor the animate boolean

	
  * Set configurable fx

	
  * enable shadows

	
  * Anything else that the community would like :)
