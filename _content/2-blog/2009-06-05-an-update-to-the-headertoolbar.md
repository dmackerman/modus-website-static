title: An update to the HeaderToolbar

---

The purpose of this post is to provide a quick update on the progress of the HeaderToolbar plugin.

I'm currently working on the following features:
- Animated Collapse
- Showing Raw buttons (option) 
- Add "collapse header toolbar" tool (matches feature from OS X);

Known issues:
- not fully compatible with IE7 & IE8 - surprised?
- Shadow for window out of sync.
- Expand/Collapse animations are not fully functional.

To those of you who question the need or desire for such a plugin, take a quick look at Windows and OSX panels as exhibit the same features.

Windows Vista/7
