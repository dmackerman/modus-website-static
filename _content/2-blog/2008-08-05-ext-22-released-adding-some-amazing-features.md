title: Ext 2.2 released adding some amazing features.

---

Ext 2.2 was dropped a few hours ago.Â  Some of the major features include a multi-select box and file upload button, both of which are amazing.Â  A new history manager is something that took a lot of us by surprise.Â  I cannot wait to start poking around with this.Â  Firefox 3 is now officially supported, which is a very welcome change :).Â  Great job to the Ext team for a fabulous release.
