title: SenchaCon 2013 Recap

---

Alas, SenchaCon 2013 has come and went. It was a busy, fun, productive, but very rewarding week for us. As a Gold Sponsor and [Sencha Premier Partner](http://moduscreate.com/services/), this was something we had been preparing for all year and for good reason. The best and brightest from Sencha community were in attendance as well as dozens of IT leaders, both current and prospective adopters of Sencha’s frameworks. A wealth of excellent sessions, an amazing party and a great venue conspired to create an absolutely top-notch event. Many thanks to the Sencha team for putting it all together. 













### Highlights





Expectations were high for some new and exciting announcements. All of Sencha’s core products have made incredible progress in terms of stability, performance and features since Sencha’s last conference two years prior. It was time for something new.





###### Sencha Space





Sencha has hit the sweet spot right in the heart of it. [Sencha space](http://sencha.com/products/space) is a solution for provisioning enterprise mobile apps and eliminating BYOD challenges was a creative idea that could pay dividends for Sencha and its many mobile customers. It offers an encrypted sandbox that allows your applications to co-exist and send messages to each other for application interoperability. The demo looked impressive - simple and beautifully designed. Our engineers have had an exclusive privilege to test it out first hand, only to realize that the most amazing mobile apps are yet to happen.





We're very excited to work with Sencha in changing the BYOD landscape.





###### ExtJS and Touch





Ext JS got a bit of mobility with tablet support, but noted that there would be no convergence of the two frameworks at this time. CEO, Michael Mullany announced the news during the keynote boiling it down to one key challenge: Internet Explorer. Too many ExtJS customers rely on outdated versions of the browser and this makes such a convergence intractable. However, Sencha is providing a solution from a different angle: touch support in ExtJS. This could prove very appealing to enterprises looking to bring tablet support to their ExtJS applications.





Of course, ExtJS and Sencha Touch will get their share of new bells and whistles too. Grid Gadgets, a much improved Border Layout and some MVC improvements will be coming to ExtJS. Below is Jacky Nguyen showing off the too-many-to-describe enhancements coming in Sencha Touch:

###### Architect





Thanks to Aaron Conran and team, Sencha Architect is no longer a beginner’s tool. Now with Appurify test integration, templates, improved theming integration it will surely attract more and more intermediate and advanced developers. This tool has seen significant investment from Sencha in the past few years and appears to be quite successful. I can’t wait to see how it evolves from here.





###### Fastbook





Jacky Nguyen gave an amazing talk on Fastbook, Sencha’s answer to Facebook’s criticism of HTML5. This was in-depth, advanced material so I won’t attempt to rehash it here, but when the session videos are released, I highly recommend this one to front-end developers.





### Modus @ SenchaCon





We came in full force this year. We’ve more than tripled in size since last SenchaCon and this year there were ten of us in attendance! Below is some of the team hard at work in our lounge prior to the kickoff:

Many thanks to all the people that stopped by to chat, grab a t-shirt, book or sticker. It was exciting and humbling to see so many of our awesome "init() to win it" shirts being worn throughout the conference!





###### Getting in Touch With Modus Experts





We were really humbled by the great interest we received at our Modus lounge in the community pavilion so special thanks to all of you who shared your ideas and questions with us. If you’re looking to manage and deliver your next enterprise Sencha project with confidence, but didn't get to talk to us in Orlando, just [let us know](http://moduscreate.com/contact/) and we'll be happy get in touch with you.





###### Creating Custom Components with Sencha Touch





Modus Create CTO, Jay Garcia gave an excellent session on custom components, drawing from his years of development and teaching. In this talk, Jay described the art of custom Sencha Touch components. Jay's session was packed with viewers:

###### DJing with Sencha Touch





Congrats to Modus Create’s Stan Bershadskiy who gave an amazingly educative conference session on a subject near and dear for him. He built a slick [DJ app](http://moduscreate.com/touch-dj-a-sencha-touch-dj-app/) with Sencha Touch and Node.js and delivered a great demonstration of the cutting edge HTML5 Web Audio API!









###### Unconference





For the first time ever, the unconference concept emerged to SenchaCon. Modus Create CEO Pat Sheridan led an engaging discussion on bringing agile and lean techniques to manage large scale software development efforts. The feedback was purely phenomenal, showing the community's positive attitude to learning about successful business methodologies.





### What’s Next?
