## **General Dynamics to host an Ext JS and JavaScript Meetup**





After a successful and full meetup [at Three Pillar Global on 1/19/2010](http://moduscreate.com/219/three-pillar-global-plays-host-to-an-extjs-gathering), General Dynamics has graciously invited us to host a meetup at their Northern Virginia location.   Pat Sheridan and Jay Garcia have selected two key topics that are essential to building dynamic and robust Ext JS applications.





## About the presentations:





## **Theming Ext JS, Pat Sheridan**





I'll give some practical code walkthrough on understanding the default theme CSS, using Renderers, and writing/ overriding Ext Templates to give your app a unique look and feel.





## **Using Base Classes, Jay Garcia**





Jay will explore the benefits of using base classes to improve and standardize application infrastructure.
He will walk through a real time example writing a base class and two implementation classes.





Food and refreshments to be provided.  We look forward to [seeing you there!](http://www.meetup.com/NoVa-Javascript-Ext-JS-Users-Group/calendar/12529642/)
