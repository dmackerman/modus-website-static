title: Some small updates to the ext-doc project

---

I finally got around to spending time with the Ext-doc project today and have modified a few things. Original credit for the toolbar changes, which include the 'direct link' button go to [Shea Frederick](http://vinylfox.com), an awesome Ext JS developer and author of [Learning Ext JS](http://learningextjs.com).Â  You can download a nightly snapshot here: [http://code.google.com/p/ext-doc/](http://code.google.com/p/ext-doc/)

See below:

Some future goals:

- Add the TabPanel close menu

- Make a better welcome.html with useful information

- Upgrade the docs to Ext JS 3.0
