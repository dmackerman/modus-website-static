2011 was a dynamic and exciting year for us at Modus Create.  As we start the new year and settle in to our new office,  I wanted to share some thoughts from our internal discussions on what to expect for HTML5 app development in the coming months.


### HTML5 Evolves from Buzzword to Core Technology Platform


2012 is the year Mobile Web Apps will come online.  Most firms continue to struggle with mobile product development and the first generation of native mobile apps were held to a much lower standard for user experience.  As consumers expectations become more sophisticated, the ever increasing portfolio of novelty or ‘executive pet project’ mobile apps will have to be replace by a scalable, cost effective, HTML5 mobile web app model.


### The 'Hybrid App' Development Becomes Migration Plan for Native Apps


Many firms we speak to look at HTML5 as their ‘everything else’ strategy beyond iOS.   For firms that have focused on native iOS apps, HTML5 will be their platform of choice for covering Android, Windows, and Blackberry devices.   Of course there are specific hardware features available to native mobile apps that packaging tools such as PhoneGap make available to HTML5 developers:  camera, GPS, compass, accelerometer, and local storage to name a few.  Hybrid Apps, apps that deploy HTML5 content wrapped in a native wrapper of code, [allow for a smooth transition point to more scalable solutions](http://venturebeat.com/2011/07/08/hybrid-mobile-apps-take-off-as-html5-vs-native-debate-continues/).


### Facebook embraces HTML5


[Facebook will release project Spartan](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/facebook-project-spartan/) and most likely it’s own phone optimized to run HTML5 based games and apps as direct challenge to iOS.  Facebook [acquired HTML5 platform company Strobe ](http://blog.strobecorp.com/?p=304)towards the end of 2011 and [looks to be boosting it’s developer community relations](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/sencha_loses_mobile_developer_guru_james_pearce_to.php).  With the release of 'Timeline' we believe Facebook is beginning to draw a line between the content and app experience on Facebook and HTML5 will be the technology that Facebook use to become an app distribution channel.


### Open Government = Mobile Web Apps


Citizen engagement is predicated on citizen access.  Just as CMS platform like Drupal and Wordpress revolutionized the way agencies standardize and manage web content, HTML5 based mobile friendly sites and apps that can easily pull content from existing CMS infratructure will revolutionize how agencies large and small achieve their mission.


### HTML5 Challenges the “Native App & Store” Distribution (and Business) Model


Scale is the primary driver for HTML5 growth.  As enterprises shift mobile from vanity projects to core technology, the 30% 'Tax' levied to use native iTunes Store and Android Market will become increasingly seen as lost revenue.  Firms will increasingly look to hybrid apps and mobile web apps to grow their marketshare beyond iOS devices and leapfrog over the need to add native Android development to their operational stack.  As companies look to maximize mobile app revenues, they will be increasing motivated to recapture profit lost to pay for access to a delivery channel.
