title: 'Ext.ux.TDGi.MenuKeyTrigger: A MenuItem key triggering plugin'

categories:

After much frustration with not having this feature, I developed a plugin to allow that allows you to attach a key (letter) for which to trigger the handler of an ExtJS Menu item.   I call it  [Ext.ux.TDGi.MenuKeyTrigger](http://github.com/tdgi/Ext.ux.TDGi.MenuKeyTrigger).  I cannot tell you enough how many times I wished this was in some of the Ext JS applications I was developing and testing.





As an avid keyboard junkie, I really hate to have to move the mouse a lot.  Hell, being an OS X user, there is much to be desired with the UI in this arena, especially after using Windows since 3.0 and getting spoiled with its well-baked accessibility features.





I developed this plugin about 8 months ago, but have had little time to really polish it due to the the work on my book, [Ext JS in Action](http://extjsinaction.com).  But with that nearing completion, I've taken the time to release it tonight in it's beta form, in hopes that I could get some feedback to improve it.  :)
