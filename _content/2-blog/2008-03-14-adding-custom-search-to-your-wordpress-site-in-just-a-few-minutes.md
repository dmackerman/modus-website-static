title: Adding Custom Search to your wordpress site in just a few minutes!

---

For those us who are familiar with the ext combo box examples, you may be able to recall the awesome forum-search code.  I wanted similar functionality, but needed to change some things to make it fit for this site.    I found that the horizontal space required for the tool bar was too much for my blog use.  Also, bottom placement of the paging tool bar, which seems to be  a favorite  among many Ext developers, is not something I particularly care for.   From my observation, it requires the user to move the mouse too far downward to click the next/previous buttons, thus reducing UI efficiency.

So, I took  a combination of the forum-search.html example and applied it to my previous work for [styling results of a combo box using XTemplates](http://moduscreate.com/20/custom-combobox-query-results-via-xtemplates).

So in about an hour or two, I came up with something that fits my taste, search bar size and is easier to read.   I still need to apply custom CSS to the mouseover for the search results and the text area focus.   This code will soon make it's way to my wife's site, [bebe kisses](http://bebekisses.com) as well as a few customers.
