title: JSMag August 2009 available - Developing plugins with Ext JS

---

I'm elated to share the news that the August edition of JSMag is out today, complete with a five page article that I wrote regarding development of plugins with ExtJS.  This article explains the very basics of the Component model and how plugins are brought to life and play a role in the Component model.  This article is a mere $4.99, and is worth every penny from my point of view.  

Also in this month's edition is an excellent spread from [Shea Frederick](http://www.vinylfox.com/), author of L[earning Ext JS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847195148?ie=UTF8&tag=viny07-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1847195148), which covers events from the ground up.  Shea is a leading ExtJS community member and can be contacted via [http://vinylfox.com](http://www.vinylfox.com/)
