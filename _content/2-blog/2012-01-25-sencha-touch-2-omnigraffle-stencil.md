![Sencha Touch 2 Omnigraffle Stencil](http://moduscreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/omnigraffle1.png)

I have produced a set of Sencha Touch 2 OmniGraffle stencils based around the [kitchen sink](http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/touch/examples/kitchensink/index.html) demo that Sencha has developed. Using this set of stencils, you should effectively be able to quickly wireframe and prototype a base theme Sencha Touch application.

Included are the majority of the UI elements, and in the set you will find buttons, toolbars, form elements, modals, overlays, alerts, tab bars, and a date picker.



	
  * **[Download the OmniGraffle .gstencil here](http://moduscreate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Sencha-Touch-2-All.zip)**



The stencil will also be posted to [Graffletopia](http://www.graffletopia.com) shortly, so you can search for it inside of OmniGraffle and download it that way as well.

**Update**: The stencil has been approved on Graffletopia. You can find it [here](http://graffletopia.com/stencils/844).

We'd love to hear your feedback!
